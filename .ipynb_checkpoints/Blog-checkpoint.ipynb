    "## 2. Single Image Restoration Using Deep Image Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deep Image Restoration Paradigm\n",
    "In current deep learning paradigm, the task of image restoration through generation of the restored image is commonly thought to involve training of the network parameters over a large dataset. A simple approach within this paradigm is to realize a network as below\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = f_{\\theta}(x_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where network parameters, clean image output and corrupted image input are denoted with $\\theta$, $x$, $x_0$ respectively. After training with multiple clean-corrupted image pairs, this network may be expected to output clean image $x$ when the corrupted image $x_0$ is presented as input in the test phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "The learned parameters achieved as a result of training on multiple images is expected to learn reversing the corruption by being able to extract image priors from the corrupted data. Formally, this network at hand should estimate the following likelihood;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x|x_0) \\tilde{=}  p(x_0|x)p(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p(x)$ here refers to the image prior. In this particular image restoration task, it refers to the probability of pixel values formed by the actual content of the image before the corruption with its features such as edges, surfaces or higher level content. Consequently, a realistic estimate of the prior is needed for a succesful image restoration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers are crticial of this approach, particularly due to the unclear nature of how priors are learned through this type of training and because of the possiblity of overfit to the training samples instead. They claim that the information needed in order to capture an estimate of the image prior at least which includes a sufficient level of low-level image statistics can be extracted from the single \"test image\". Thus, the network can be handcrafted to contain prior information in its parameters without any training. The parameters can then be used for outputting a restored image estimate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Realistic Image Generation using Encoder/Decoder Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement their proposed method, the researchers utilize a generator network architecture which is used for outputting realistic images from random noise such that;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = f_{\\theta}(z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $z$ is an image formed with random noise and $a$ is the output image. The parameters of the network $f_{\\theta}$ determines nature of the content that will be generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverting Images Without Learning Through Energy Minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "While encoder-decoder network uses generative model, image restoration can also be done using discriminative model. Therefore, another method the researchers use is through minimization of loss without using learning. Let $\\alpha$, $x_0$, $\\alpha_*$ denote the variable image to be optimized, the corrupted image at hand and the solution for optimization problem respectively;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_* = argmin_{\\alpha} L(\\alpha,x_0) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this minimization will lead to a trivial solution where $\\alpha_*=x_0$. Adding a regularization factor is found to achieve a different result.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_* = argmin_{\\alpha} L(\\alpha,x_0) + R(\\alpha) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If carefully selected depending on the task, the regularization term combined with the right choice of function can be used for the image restoration task, to achieve an estimate of $x$, the clean image. An example given for R(x) is total variation (TV) which leads the optimization path away from noisy outcomes. The regularization term, crafted for the particular task can also be seen to capture the prior information despite it being generic. The total variation regularizer capturing the smooth surface features for the denoising task is an example of this generic prior extraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deep Image Prior Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the frameworks introduced above, the researchers introduced the following minimizer for the task of generating the clean image.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta_* = argmin_{\\theta} L(f_{\\theta}(z),x_0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is the random image input. Compared with the approach denoted in the previous subsection, the optimization is done over the network parameters denoted with $\\theta$ instead of the input variables that are expected to be transformed into the clean image. The corrupted image is still used as the target of the loss minimization but the regularizer which was able to capture generic prior information is now replaced by the deep network which provides powerful parameters for capturing the prior information specific to the image that is being processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to the approach discussed in the first section, this approach involves optimization, not training with the aim of optimized parameters $\\theta$ acquiring the prior information needed to produce the clean image as such;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = f_{\\theta_{i}(z)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_{i(z)}$ denotes parameters during iteration i, given an iterative optimization is employed. The random image $z$ remains the same throughout the optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this \"useful\" parameters are not those that are solutions of the optimization problem denoted as $\\theta_*$ which leads to the corrupted image again. This is defined as the overfitting case of this method by the researchers, and a key aspect of this method is early stopping. This results in the Î¸ settling for a local optimum as long as the number of iterations in the optimization process remains low enough not to overfit data.\n",

    "## 3. Objective and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the inpainting task will be focused on, in which the corrupted image has lost pixels, and the task is to generate the complete image. We will employ the following loss function which is used by the researchers;\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L(\\alpha,x_0) = | (\\alpha-x_0) \\circ m |^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\circ$ refers to Hadamard product which provides pixel-wise multiplicion with the mask $m$ and the resulting difference image between the current output of the network and the corrupted image, which is formed by applying the mask $m$ to the clean image $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of mask that will be used in experiments, which are 50% bernoulli and text masks. The bernoulli masked image is formed by masking 50% of pixels selected according to random distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Bernouli](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14TtSCn5YvLj1f4yD3EQxyExWTKnzU6_4)\n",
    "\n",
    "The text mask is formed by masking the image with letters written on the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Text over Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1begQmJE4i69fH3pOBk6Za9EfOVfuvB22)\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project can be summarized to provide evaluation for claims made by the authors on how this method works while also attempting to replicate a part of the results reported. These claims are;\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Erroreuous early-stopping leads to undesired results due to the model converging to the optimal, corrupted image.** \n",
    "*   **The method gives better results compared to legacy methods employed in [Papyan et. al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03239.pdf) for inpainting task with 50% bernoulli noise.**\n",
    "*   **The network structure should resonate with the task at hand.**\n",
    "*   **The network is handcrafted for the particular image as a parametrization of the prior.**\n",
    "*   **Better inpainting results are obtained with deeper networks.**\n",
    "*   **Adding skip connections that cause network to work \"too well\" is detrimental to the performance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As it will be shown in experiment 3 and 1, we have observed that early-stopping is not crucial due to the regularizing nature of the architecture, in contrast to **Claim 1**. **Claim 2** is shown to be correct by succesful replication of the results close to the those given on the table. In line with other claims, the architecture of the network; mainly it's depthness and number of skip connections is also observed to be determining the pattern that can be produced by the natwork, thus impactinng the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Default Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture that is employed in our experiments is based on the model specification provided by the researchers, and the existing pytorch module for generating the network is utilized. The figure below illustrates the components of the default architecture;\n",
    "\n",
    "![arch](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1drExrkoL-MYCpMdh_xq_i4HfY5MXLz6X)\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture consists of an ecoder - decoder system with the flexibility of having skip connections. The downsampling blocks form the encoder, the upsampling blocks form the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder extracts vital features preserving the detailed underlying structure of the image, the context and the location of that information, whereas the decoder produces a clean version of the input image by recovering image details as it progresses through its layers in a bottom-up way after the last layer of the encoder. Each skip connection allows to directly transfer the information from an encoder layer to its corresponding decoder one, and this is appealing since the corrupted image and output clean version share large parts of the low-level information like the location of prominent edges. In fact, skip connections allow to remember different levels of details that are useful to reconstruct the final output image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of downsampling, upsampling and skip layers should be equal.\n",
    "* $d_{i}$ - downsampling connection\n",

But comparison with the result of these should be avoided as the bernoulli mask method used causes the mask to be colored as well, making the problem more similar to denoising than inpainting. This is probably due to the authors only meant this mask to be used in grayscale images, but we chose include them anyway.\n",

    "The steady increase in PSNR's are in line with the convergence behaviour described by the authors. As they noted in (supmat) a destabilization occurs for some images troughout optimization, captured as the large PSNR drops in this graph. These are described by a large amount of sudden increase in MSE in their trials, resulting in excessively blurry images before the MSE gets stabilized again. We are convinced that the drops in PSNR is indeed due to this. Contrary to a sharp MSE increase that may lead the image to converge to the noisy, corrupted image quickly, these destabilizations drop the PSNR computed with the clean image as well, keeping the parameters away from the desired result. This has been confirmed in the following trial producing a full dark image resulting from an extreme destabilization and next Experiment 3, for which we were able to get the blurred image formed at the bottom of this PSNR drops. \n",

    "The results obtained from Experiment 1 made it possible for close replication of results with those reported on the paper for table 1. In both original and replication results, the images with large smooth regions led to better PSNR results. \n",

An example is the house test image which involves a large area covering the sky above the roof. Lena, which came second in the paper and third in the replication results includes large areas that correspond to woman's skin and the background. \n",
    "\n",
    "There may be two reasons behind this pattern;\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, due to each error value for each pixel having equal contribution to the PSNR value, the large smooth regions become a critical determinant of the resulting PSNR. Once those regions are fixed, the PSNR value for the image can reach high levels without having reached succesful results for the rest of the regions which may be semantically more significant despite their smaller size. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, the parametrization in use is able to produce smooth regions much more easily than noisy regions, which is the main motivcation behind this method as explained by authors. An important result for this ranking is that the impedance towards noise here not only involves uncorrelated noise which is resulted by random deletion of pixels, but also correlated noise that is part of the prior when smooth regions are taken as the original signal, such as the high frequency regions in images that performed worse. \n",

    "These images sampled from indepeendent random noise illustrate the capability of these networks regarding the type of pattern they can produce, giving an idea on how much they \"resonate\" with a particular pattern due to their structure, as noted by authorrs. The architecture used in these trials is the one referred in the second column from the right. Altough it is able to produce higher frequency patterns as opposed to the version without skip connections on it's left which only produce a blurry pattern, it is observed that higher frequency patterns above some level are still not likely to be observed, still producing a rather blurry image. This is in line with the fact that the neural network is more likely to succeed when given images with large smooth regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Results from Experiment 2 are also in line with the fact that the depthness and the skip connections of the network determine what it can produce, and impact the results accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the architecture's likeliness to produce a particular kind of pattern, which can be sampled from the independent noise distribution also enables for explaining another result obtained in trials of Experiment 1 and 3, which is related to nearly-monotonic increase of PSNR values except the sudden drops. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting experimentation, we expected to have PSNR curves that go down after some iterations of reaching a maximum value due to the optimization being done with comparison to the corrupted image. In this scenario, altough going through the clean image solution halfway through, the parameters would eventually converge to the actual optimal solution, the corrupted image, making the early-stopping crucial. This convergence path is illustrated below in the journal paper of the authors:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Convergence](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVWiaVOXgAIsHXs?format=jpg&name=large)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Experiment 1 and 3, except destabilizations leading to sudden drops, the PSNR curve is seen to improve and stay steadily after some point without decreasing again even when the number of iterations is doubled, or the learning rate is increased. This led us to conclude that altough there may be infinite possibities of images for the network to produce, these possiblities are confined in a parameter space that is determinend by the architecture acting like a regularizer. Thus, when parameters are initialized with small values, the network simply is not able to produce the corrupted image even if it's optimized using it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to the regularization implicitly determined by the network, regardless of the early stopping. So instead of the graph above, another one with a shell that encapsulated achievable solutions, and the $x_0$ being outside this shell, far from the $x_{gt}$ would be more accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "An implication result of this is that for some tasks and architectures, **early-stopping may not be crucial due to the reason that we want to prevent the network converging to $x_0$ but due the reason that we want to avoid destabilizations that may occur on the boundary of regularizer**. This is in line with the results obtained in Trial 3 in particular, for which the destabilization caused an irreversible degradation. The more iterations, the more it becomes likely for such sudden drop to happen. Increased learning rate is another factor leading to more detrimental destabilizations.  \n",

    "In conclusion, we have succesfully reproduced the results given for Table 1 of [Ulyanov et al.](https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior) as well as results related to text-inpainting task producing similar valuest to those reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of regularization by the network itself is clearly observed and sudden increases in optimized MSE reported by authors is confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The changes in architecture is observed to lead changes in performance. Skip conections are confirmed to be detrimenntal for shallow networks while they provide means for details to be transferred to the output for deeper architectures. \n",
